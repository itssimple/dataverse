# Dataverse

Dataverse is yet another Destiny 2 thing that I might not finish. (At least I'm honest)

The goal of the app, is to have:

- Website with a checklist of what to do, the progress of quests, bounties and so on
- Optional overlay software connected to the website, to get a permanent overlay solution in-game
